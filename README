dietsplash
==========

Simple bootsplash that aims to adhere to the KISS philosophy. As such, don't
expect fancy animations while your computer is booting. All that we want is an
image and hopefully some boot status indication.

BIG FAT WARNING
***************

It does not work yet. All you'll get if you compile it is a penguin drawn to
your framebuffer.
